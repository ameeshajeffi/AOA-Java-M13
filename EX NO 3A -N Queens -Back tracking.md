# EX 3A N Queens Problem - Backtracking Approach.
## DATE: 9.10.25
## AIM:
To Write a Java program for N queens using backtracking approach.
You are given an integer N. For a given N x N chessboard, find a way to place 'N' queens such that no queen can attack any other queen on the chessboard.
A queen can be attacked when it lies in the same row, column, or the same diagonal as any of the other queens. You have to print one such configuration.

Note :

Get the input from the user for N . The value of N must be from 1 to 4

If solution exists Print a binary matrix as output that has 1s for the cells where queens are placed

If there is no solution to the problem  print  "Solution does not exist"

## Algorithm
1. Start with an empty N×N board and attempt to place queens column by column.

2. For each column, try placing a queen in every row of that column.

3. Before placing a queen, check if the position is safe by ensuring: No queen exists on the left row, No queen exists on the upper-left diagonal, No queen exists
   on the lower-left diagonal.

4. If the position is safe, place the queen and recursively attempt to place the rest of the queens in the next column.

5. If placing in the next column fails, backtrack by removing the queen and trying the next row.

6. When all columns are filled, a solution is found; print the board. If no position works in the first column, then no solution exists.
